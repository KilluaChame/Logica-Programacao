### Exercise 1: Exploring Primitive Types

Create a program that:

- Declares variables of the following primitive types:
  - `int` (integer numbers)
  - `double` (decimal numbers)
  - `boolean` (true/false)
  - `char` (a single character)
- Assign values to these variables.
- Display the values in the console.

**Expected Output (example):**

```java
Integer: 45
Decimal: 3.14
Boolean: true
Character: M
```

### Exercise 2: Manipulating Strings

Create a program that:

1. Asks the user for two names and stores them in `String` variables.
2. Combines the two names into a third variable.
3. Displays the combined name.
4. Shows the length (number of characters) of the combined name.

**Example:**

- User Input: Name 1: "Mateus" Name 2: "Silva"
- Expected Output:

  ```java
  Full name: Mateus Silva
  Number of characters: 12
  ```

### Exercise 3: Working with Arrays

Create a program that:

1. Declares an array of integers with a size of 5.
2. Asks the user to fill in the 5 values.
3. Displays all the values in the array using a `for` loop.
4. Displays the sum of all the values in the array.

**Example:**

- User Input: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50
- Expected Output:
  ```java
  Values in the array:
  Position 0: 10
  Position 1: 20
  Position 2: 30
  Position 3: 40
  Position 4: 50
  Sum of values: 150
  ```

### Exercise 4: Creating and Using Objects

Create a class called `Book` with the following attributes:

- `String title`
- `String author`
- `int pages`

In the main class:

1. Create two objects of the `Book` class and assign values to their attributes.
2. Display the details of each book in the console.

**Example Output:**

```java
Book 1:
Title: Programming Logic
Author: Mateus Silva
Pages: 200

Book 2:
Title: Introduction to Java
Author: Jo√£o Santos
Pages: 350
```

### Exercise 5: Type Conversion

Create a program that:

1. Asks the user for a decimal number (`double`) and converts it to an integer (`int`).
2. Asks the user for an integer and converts it to text (`String`).
3. Displays the converted values in the console.

**Example:**

- User Input: Decimal number: 7.85 Integer number: 42
- Expected Output:
  ```java
  Decimal number converted to integer: 7
  Integer number converted to text: "42"
  ```

### Exercise 6: Type Validation

Create a program that:

1. Asks the user to enter a number.
2. Checks whether it is an integer or a decimal.
3. Displays appropriate messages depending on the type of the number.

**Example:**

- User Input: `5` Output: `You entered an integer.`
- User Input: `5.6` Output: `You entered a decimal number.`
